          <p>A shining example I’ve found in my own life lies in Riverbottom Grille’s online menu.</p>
          <img id="rbgOrder" src="../pics/rbgNavbar.png" alt="riverbottom menu">
          <p>As a business, Riverbottom Grille allows customers to call into the restaurant and place to go orders. Riverbottom’s menu is also available on delivery apps such as GrubSouth and Uber Eats. In the image above take notice of the fact there is no option to directly place a to go order from their website. While this may be a minor annoyance there are a few reasons I believe Riverbottom Grille should introduce a new page to their website that enables consumers to place orders online and then pick them up in person at the restaurant.</p>

          <img id="doorDash" src="../pics/doorDashPrice.png" alt="door dash pricing">
          <p>As you can see, Door Dash charges a percent commission on orders placed through their app. This presents a unique challenge for small business owners seeking to keep in step with the advancement of technology while still maintaining the profitability of their business. Partnering with large mobile dining corporations offers a few advantages – namely the ease of installation, increased sales from online transactions, and allowing employees to spend less time answering the phone and writing down orders. For business owners seeking to enjoy these benefits without having to pay another company, the solution lies in creating ones own mobile ordering service.</p>
